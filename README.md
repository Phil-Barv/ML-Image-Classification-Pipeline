# ML Image Classification Pipeline

As we explore the exciting field of machine learning, these papers focus on image classification. Image classification is a significant technique used in a broad range of applications, from medical diagnosis to self-driving cars. <br/>

These papers serve as a detailed tutorial that explores the topic of image classification from simple binary emotion categories to more advanced classification. In the first paper, I aim to provide a step-by-step guide to understanding the key concepts of binary image classification, which involves classifying images into one of two categories. We will cover the entire process, from data collection and preprocessing, dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets, building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, training the model, and evaluating its performance. In subsequent papers, we build on this by employing more advanced models and techniques such as XGBoost, VGG16, and GANs.<br/>

The papers will also include detailed explanations and technical details that will help readers understand the key concepts and techniques used. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the process of image classification and be able to build your own image classification models and implement the suggested extensions.
