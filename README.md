# ML Image Classification Pipeline

As we explore the exciting field of machine learning, this paper focuses on image classification. Image classification is a significant technique used in a broad range of applications, from medical diagnosis to self-driving cars. <br/>

This paper serves as a detailed tutorial that explores the topic of binary image classification. I aim to provide a step-by-step guide to understanding the key concepts of binary image classification, which involves classifying images into one of two categories. We will cover the entire process, from data collection and preprocessing, dividing the data into training, validation, and test sets, building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.<br/>

The paper will also include detailed explanations and technical details that will help readers understand the key concepts and techniques used. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the process of binary image classification and be able to build your own image classification models and implement the suggested extensions.
